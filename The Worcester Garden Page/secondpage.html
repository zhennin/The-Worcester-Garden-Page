        <h1> The Worcester Garden Page </h1>
        <h2> Welcome to the second page of our website! Here you will
            learn more about plants and nature as you did on the other page.</h2>

            <p> Benefical plants for the air can be very helpful for you and your home. A NASA study in 1989,
                showed that these benefical plants (plants listed later) can take in harmful toxins in the air, like household chemicals.
            These toxins can come from various cleaning solutions and synthetic materials. Before you go out and buy
            a plant, make sure that the plant is not toxic to your pet in any way. The downside of these plants is that
            they can promote mold growth and change humidity. If your plant has suitable drainage, mold won't be a problem
            Here is a list of some benefical plants: Areca Palm, Bamboo Palm, Lady Palm, Rubber Plant.
            </p>

            <p> Asian Longhorned Beetles also known as ALB, are prone to wiping out forests in a matter of days.
                They primarily attack maple trees, poplars, horse-chestnuts, willows, elms, mulberries, and black locusts.
                As of now there are no defenses against ALB, and the beetles have very little predators.
                ALB kill trees by nesting in trees and thir larvae spread to other trees. The only way to prevent ALB 
                is to recongnize the signs and to contact your local forestry department.
