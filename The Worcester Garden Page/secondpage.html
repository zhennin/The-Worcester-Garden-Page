        <h1> The Worcester Garden Page </h1>
        <h2> Welcome to the second page of our website! Here you will
            learn more about plants and nature as you did on the other page.</h2>

            <p> Benefical plants for the air can be very helpful for you and your home. A NASA study in 1989,
                showed that these benefical plants (plants listed later) can take in harmful toxins in the air, like household chemicals.
            These toxins can come from various cleaning solutions and synthetic materials. Before you go out and buy
            a plant, make sure that the plant is not toxic to your pet in any way. The downside of these plants is that
            they can promote mold growth and change humidity. If your plant has suitable drainage, mold won't be a problem
            Here is a list of some benefical plants: Areca Palm, Rubber Plant, Aloe Vera, Spider Plant, Gerbera Daisy,
            Snake Plant, Golden Pothos, Chrysanthemum, Red-Edged Dracaena, Weeping Fig, Azalea, English Ivy, Warneck Dracaena, Chinese Evergreen,
            Heart Leaf Philodendron, Peace Lily, Garden Mum, and the Boston Fern. 



            </p>
             Here we will list the care for the plants that we suggested to use above. Areca Palm the care of this plant is on the easier side as you need to not neglect it as it will not tolerate this. The plant will need to be watered 
             often but just to keep the soil moist in the spring and summer always let the soil dry in between waterings in winter. Only fertilize with time-realse in the spring as it burn the plant otherwise during other months.
             For the rest of the year exept winter and fall fertilize with average liquid fertilzer. Every two to three years it will need to be potted in a new pot with the same depth. To keep the plant smaller use a tighter pot.
             Potting too deeply will cause injury or death to the plant. When planting use normal potting mix with a handful of builders sand or palm soil. Rubber Plant care is not very difficult. Start with a younger plant as it 
             will adapt much better than a adult plant. light that is required is bright but not direct as it will burn it. During spring and summer keep the plants soil moist as it is growing season. During growing season you will only need to water it once a month.
             When it is over watered the leaves will turn yellow and fall off. If the plants leaves begin to droop during dormant season then slowly increase water. When propagating use a two leaves that are about six inches long have at least two sets.

            <p> Asian Longhorned Beetles also known as ALB, are prone to wiping out forests in a matter of days.
                They primarily attack maple trees, poplars, horse-chestnuts, willows, elms, mulberries, and black locusts.
                As of now there are no defenses against ALB, and the beetles have very little predators.
                ALB kill trees by nesting in trees and thir larvae spread to other trees. The only way to prevent ALB 
                is to recongnize the signs and to contact your local forestry department. Some signs of ALB are dime sized holes in trees, piles of sawdust at thebase of the infected tree and oozing sap.
