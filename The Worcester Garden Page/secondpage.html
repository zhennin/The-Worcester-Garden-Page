            <p1> Benefical plants for the air can be very helpful for you and your home. A NASA study in 1989,

            a plant, make sure that the plant is not toxic to your pet in any way. The downside of these plants is that
            they can promote mold growth and change humidity. If your plant has suitable drainage, mold won't be a problem
